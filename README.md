# Guess the Dice Roll
Project written in Python

I wrote this project so that I would have some experience with the Python language. I was able to practice using important components such as if statments, as well as write methods in Python.

This program will roll a pair of dice. The user must guess the correct sum of the two die. If they guess correctly, they win. If they guess incorrectly, the computer wins.
